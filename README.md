# Notes to WAM: A Tutorial Reconstruction

Hassan Aït-Kaci has written an excellent book about how to run Prolog on the Warren Abstract Machine.  The book is freely available online, [Warren's Abstract Machine: A Tutorial Reconstruction](http://wambook.sourceforge.net/) by Hassan Aït-Kaci

This repository contains code and notes that I wrote while reading through the book.  The notes are in Prolog or Go.  I chose the latter because I've played with [Prolog via Go](https://github.com/mndrix/golog) before.
